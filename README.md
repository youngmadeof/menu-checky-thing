# menu-checky-thing

A pretty pointless checking tool that outputs web page menu lists. Basically it's just me messing around with Java Swing GUI and seeing if I can integrate Selenium WebDriver. User inputs url and element ID for drop down or multiple select menu; checky thing outputs the menu options.
